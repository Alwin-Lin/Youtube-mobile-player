## Known Issues
- The video playback will restart when the phone is rotated.
- Tap twice to exit if a Youtube video is being played.
- When changeing close-up view positions, tap on the upper part of the full view to adjust, there is an invisble but functional controle bar present at the lower part of the screen. 
- Youtube video close-ups may be a bit pixelated, to be investgated further.
